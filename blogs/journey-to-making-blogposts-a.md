## Hello Guys and Gals

So here began my journey making blog posts because of my current predicament (unemployment)
Here is hoping im getting a job soon??

So the idea here i am gonna to make a blog website using Golang templ library.
The blog posts itself gonna be markdown files. I've made a makrdown file blog before
when dabbling with React/Nextjs, but have not in Golang. Thank God that i found this video

[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx8SMT82aa8)

This video gave me a raw idea how to read markdown file and display it using a server to the client.
But this is only just raw markdown, without the HTML tags to accompanied it. I am going to try to find
a way to parse the markdown files to HTML then hopefully add TailwindCSS to it. Hopefully the next blog
posts are about that!

Peace!!
